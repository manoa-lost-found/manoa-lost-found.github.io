## 📘 Overview

### The Problem
Each semester, UH Mānoa students lose countless items — IDs, water bottles, textbooks, AirPods, and other valuables. While the university technically has a Lost & Found system, it’s inefficient and fragmented. The current process involves emailing departments, calling offices, or physically visiting locations like Campus Center or the Library. There’s no centralized platform for checking updates, leaving students unsure if their lost items will ever be found.

### The Solution
**Manoa Lost & Found** is a centralized digital platform that unifies reporting and recovering lost items across UH Mānoa. Students and staff can:
- Post **Lost** or **Found** items with descriptions, images, and locations.
- Receive **notifications** when potential matches are found.
- Use **UH authentication** for security and campus-only access.
- Route physical returns through **official UH offices** for verified recovery.

> All item exchanges are handled through official UH offices — no private handoffs.

### 🧾 Finders (Any Authenticated User)

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| UH authentication complexity | Start with demo/login; integrate UH SSO later |
| Matching accuracy | Start with keyword filters; add fuzzy/AI synonyms later |
| Duplicate posts | Simple duplicate detection + admin merge tools |
| Privacy & safety | No private handoffs; all returns through UH offices |
| Moderation load | Admin workflows + flags + status updates |

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- AI synonym/fuzzy search (e.g., “AirPods” ≈ “Apple earbuds”)  
- QR poster generator linking to item pages  
- Campus map markers for last-seen and turn-in points  
- Auto-archive stale posts unless renewed  
- Recovery metrics (e.g., “123 items reunited this semester”)
